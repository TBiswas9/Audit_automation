# Audit_automation
 Automation of the audit process based on the audit logic received from the quality team

 The scope of this automation is to reduce the audit time, increase the sample and error detection for quick rectification.

 The error logic were throughly reviewed and finalized by the audit team.
 The logic were coded using the python and a GUI was created so that a non python user can run the audit using the code.

 The GUI is created using the tkinter library that allows the user to browse the raws report needed for the audit.
 Once the files path were loded into the GUI, the user run the audit by clicking the run button.
 The application flags all the error as defined in the log and place the audited file for the auditor to review.
